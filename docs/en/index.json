	"content": "We have two network models to choose from when deploying an AKS cluster. The first model is Kubenet networking, and the second is Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) networking.\nWhat is Kubenet networking? Kubenet networking is the default networking model in Kubernetes. With Kubenet networking, nodes get assigned an IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet. Pods receive an IP address from a logically different address space to the Azure virtual network subnet of the nodes.\nNetwork address translation (NAT) is then configured so that the pods can reach resources on the Azure virtual network. The source IP address of the traffic is translated to the node\u0026rsquo;s primary IP address and then configured on the nodes. Note, that pods receive an IP address that\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;hidden\u0026rdquo; behind the node IP.\nWhat is Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) networking? With Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI), the AKS cluster is connected to existing virtual network resources and configurations. In this networking model, every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space and calculated in advance.\nSome of the features you\u0026rsquo;ll use require you to deploy the AKS cluster by using the Azure Container Networking Interface networking configuration.\nFor a more detailed comparison, see the Learn more section at the end of this module.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create the virtual network for your AKS cluster. We will use this virtual network and specify the networking model when we deploy the cluster.\nFirst, create a virtual network and subnet. Pods deployed in your cluster will be assigned an IP from this subnet. Run the following command to create the virtual network.\naz network vnet create \\  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \\  --location $REGION_NAME \\  --name $VNET_NAME \\  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/8 \\  --subnet-name $SUBNET_NAME \\  --subnet-prefixes 10.240.0.0/16 Next, retrieve, and store the subnet ID in a Bash variable by running the command below.\nSUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show \\  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \\  --vnet-name $VNET_NAME \\  --name $SUBNET_NAME \\  --query id -o tsv) "

	"content": "With the new virtual network in place, you can go ahead and create your new cluster. There are two values you need to know before running the az aks create command. The first is the version of the latest, non-preview, Kubernetes version available in your selected region, and the second is a unique name for your cluster.\nTo get the latest, non-preview, Kubernetes version you use the az aks get-versions command. Store the value that returns from the command in a Bash variable named VERSION. Run the command below the retrieve and store the version number.\nVERSION=$(az aks get-versions \\  --location $REGION_NAME \\  --query \u0026#39;orchestrators[?!isPreview] | [-1].orchestratorVersion\u0026#39; \\  --output tsv) The AKS cluster name must be unique.

You\u0026rsquo;ll need it to reconfigure the variable in the future, if necessary.\necho $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME Run the following az aks create command to create the AKS cluster running the latest Kubernetes version.

Note the following deployment configuration:\n  --vm-set-type: We\u0026rsquo;re specifying that the cluster is created by using virtual machine scale sets. The virtual machine scale sets enable you to switch on the cluster autoscaler when needed.\n  --node-count: We\u0026rsquo;re specifying that the cluster is created with two nodes. The default node count is three nodes. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re running this exercise using a free trial account, cluster creation may fail due to quota limits if left at the default setting.\n  --network-plugin: We\u0026rsquo;re specifying the creation of the AKS cluster by using the CNI plug-in.\n  --service-cidr: This address range is the set of virtual IPs that Kubernetes assigns to internal services in your cluster. The range must not be within the virtual network IP address range of your cluster. It should be different from the subnet created for the pods.\n  --dns-service-ip: The IP address is for the cluster\u0026rsquo;s DNS service. This address must be within the Kubernetes service address range. Don\u0026rsquo;t use the first IP address in the address range, such as 0.1. The first address in the subnet range is used for the kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local address.\n  --docker-bridge-address: The Docker bridge network address represents the default docker0 bridge network address present in all Docker installations. AKS clusters or the pods themselves don\u0026rsquo;t use docker0 bridge. However, you have to set this address to continue supporting scenarios such as docker build within the AKS cluster. It\u0026rsquo;s required to select a classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) for the Docker bridge network address. If you don\u0026rsquo;t set a CIDR, Docker chooses a subnet automatically. This subnet could conflict with other CIDRs. Choose an address space that doesn\u0026rsquo;t collide with the rest of the CIDRs on your networks, which includes the cluster\u0026rsquo;s service CIDR and pod CIDR.\n  "

Default and Chapter. Both can be used at any level of the documentation, the only difference being layout display.\nA Chapter displays a page meant to be used as introduction for a set of child pages. Commonly, it contains a simple title and a catch line to define content that can be found under it. You can define any HTML as prefix for the menu. In the example below, it\u0026rsquo;s just a number but that could be an icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Basics\u0026#34; chapter = true weight = 5 pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;1. \u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\u0026#34; +++ ### Chapter 1  # Basics Discover what this Hugo theme is all about and the core-concepts behind it. To tell Hugo-theme-learn to consider a page as a chapter, set chapter=true in the Front Matter of the page.\nA Default page is any other content page.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Installation\u0026#34; weight = 15 +++ The following steps are here to help you initialize your new website. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you to train by following this great documentation for beginners.\nCreate your project Hugo provides a new command to create a new website.\nhugo new site \u0026lt;new_project\u0026gt; Hugo-theme-learn provides archetypes to help you create this kind of pages.\nFront Matter configuration Each Hugo page has to define a Front Matter in yaml, toml or json.\nHugo-theme-learn uses the following parameters on top of Hugo ones :\n+++ # Table of content (toc) is enabled by default. Set this parameter to true to disable it. # Note: Toc is always disabled for chapter pages disableToc = \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; # If set, this will be used for the page\u0026#39;s menu entry (instead of the `title` attribute) menuTitle = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be prefixed by this HTML content pre = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # The title of the page in menu will be postfixed by this HTML content post = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Set the page as a chapter, changing the way it\u0026#39;s displayed chapter = false # Hide a menu entry by setting this to true hidden = false # Display name of this page modifier. If set, it will be displayed in the footer. LastModifierDisplayName = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Email of this page modifier. If set with LastModifierDisplayName, it will be displayed in the footer LastModifierEmail = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; +++ Add icon to a menu entry In the page frontmatter, add a pre param to insert any HTML code before the menu label. The example below uses the Github icon.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Github repo\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;i class=\u0026#39;fab fa-github\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026#34; +++ Ordering sibling menu/page entries Hugo provides a flexible way to handle order for your pages.\nThe simplest way is to set weight parameter to a number.\n+++ title = \u0026#34;My page\u0026#34; weight = 5 +++ Using a custom title for menu entries By default, Hugo-theme-learn will use a page\u0026rsquo;s title attribute for the menu item (or linkTitle if defined).\nBut a page\u0026rsquo;s title has to be descriptive on its own while the menu is a hierarchy. We\u0026rsquo;ve added the menuTitle parameter for that purpose:\nFor example (for a page named content/install/linux.md):\n+++ title = \u0026#34;Install on Linux\u0026#34; menuTitle = \u0026#34;Linux\u0026#34; +++ Homepage To configure your home page, you basically have three choices:\n Create an _index.md document in content folder and fill the file with Markdown content Create an index.html file in the static folder and fill the file with HTML content Configure your server to automatically redirect home page to one your documentation page  "

Only difference is information about image customization (resizing, add CSS classes\u0026hellip;)\n Let\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\n Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use!  John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\n The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. \u0026ndash; John Gruber\n Grav ships with built-in support for Markdown and Markdown Extra. You must enable Markdown Extra in your system.yaml configuration file\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:\nBookmark this page for easy future reference!\n Headings Headings from h1 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n# h1 Heading ## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading Renders to:\nh1 Heading h2 Heading h3 Heading h4 Heading h5 Heading h6 Heading HTML:\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;h1 Heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Comments Comments should be HTML compatible\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\nHorizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements.

For example, each of these chapters:\n# Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. NOTE that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.\nImages Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax\nAlternative usage : note images ![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026quot;The Dojocat\u0026quot;  Resizing image Add HTTP parameters width and/or height to the link image to resize the image.

For example, the following code block references an imaginary language foo. An error will be output to the console on this page.\n```foo bar ``` Could not find the language 'foo', did you forget to load/include a language module?(anonymous) @ highlight.pack.js Supporting additional languages To support languages other than the 38 common languages included in the default highlight.js you will need to download your own version of highlight.js and add it to your site content.\nDownload custom highlight.js Visit https://highlightjs.org/download/ and select your desired language support. Note that more languages means greater package size.\nAdd custom highlight.js to static resources Inside the zip archive downloaded from highlight.js extract the file named highlight.pack.js. Move this file to the new location\nstatic/js/highlight.pack.js Do not replace the existing file at themes/hugo-theme-learn/static/js/highlight.pack.js.\nIncluding the file in the correct path will override the theme default highlight.pack.js and prevent issues caused in the future if the theme default file is updated.\nFurther usage information See https://highlightjs.org/usage/\n"

It\u0026rsquo;s not replaced with default language content.\n Use slug Front Matter parameter to translate urls too.\n Overwrite translation strings Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme (Edit this page button, Search placeholder and so on). Translations are available in french and english but you may use another language or want to override default values.\nTo override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder i18n/\u0026lt;idlanguage\u0026gt;.toml and inspire yourself from the theme themes/hugo-theme-learn/i18n/en.toml\nBy the way, as these translations could be used by other people, please take the time to propose a translation by making a PR to the theme !\nDisable language switching Switching the language in the browser is a great feature, but for some reasons you may want to disable it.\nJust set disableLanguageSwitchingButton=true in your config.toml\n[params] # When using mulitlingual website, disable the switch language button. disableLanguageSwitchingButton = true "
